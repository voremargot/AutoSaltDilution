<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline; font-size:20px">Data Sources and Notes </p>
<p style= "font-size:16px">Note that this table has <strong> 2 primary key columns </strong> </p>
<strong><u>EventID:</u></strong> The EventID value is generated by the autosalt system when a dump event occurs. This ID value comes from the raw dump event file and is a primary key column. <br>
<strong><u>SiteID:</u></strong> This corresponds to the primary key in the site description table, specifying which site the dump event took place at AND is a primary key column. <br>
<strong><u> PeriodID:</u></strong> This corresponds to the primary key in the barrel periods table and specifies which barrel period the dump event took place during. <br>
<strong><u> Date: </u></strong> This is the date the dump event occurred on. The date comes from the summary file of dump events in the Hakai repository. <br>
<strong><u> Temp:</u></strong> This is the stream temperature at the start of the dump event. The information comes from the summary file of dump events in the Hakai repository. <br>
<strong><u> Start Time:</u></strong> The time when the dump event began. The time comes from the summary file of dump events in the Hakai repository.<br>
<strong><u> Stage DR:</u></strong> This is the stream stage at the time of solution release. The data comes from the summary file of the dump events in the Hakai repository<br>
<strong><u> Stage Min:</u></strong> The minimum stage of the stream over the course of the dump event. The minimum value represents the lowest stage value between the start and end of the salt curve. <br>
<strong><u> Stage Max:</u></strong> The maximum stage of the stream over the course of the dump event. The maximum value represents the highest stage value between the start and end of the salt curve.<br>
<strong><u> Stage Std:</u></strong> This is the standard deviation of the stage values between the start and end of the salt curve.<br>
<strong><u> Stage Dir:</u></strong> This specifies how the stage is changing over the span of the dump event.<br>
<strong><u> Salt Volume:</u></strong> This is the amount of salt solution that is dumped into the stream during the event. This data comes from the summary file of dump events in the Hakai repository.<br>
<strong><u> Discharge Avg:</u></strong> The average of error-free, individual discharge calculations (see all discharges table). <br>
<strong><u> Uncert:</u></strong> The uncertainty of the discharge average.<br>
<strong><u> Flags:</u></strong> Highlights common errors seen within the dump event data.<br>
<strong><u> ECb:</u></strong> Highlights changes in the base EC (ECb) over the duration of the salt curve.<br>
<strong><u> Notes:</u></strong> Specific comments about the overall discharge average or dump event.<br>

<strong><u> Temp</u></strong> --> degrees C <br>
<strong><u> Stage DR</u></strong> --> cm<br>
<strong><u> Stage Average</u></strong> --> cm<br>
<strong><u> Stage Min</u></strong> --> cm <br>
<strong><u> Stage Max</u></strong> --> cm <br>
<strong><u> Stage Std</u></strong> --> cm <br>
<strong><u> Salt Volume</u></strong> --> L <br>

<br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Flags</p>
<strong><u> Flags </u></strong><br>
ND -> No raw data was found for the dump event <br>
NW -> Raw data was avaliable but there no salt wave occurred<br>
PW -> Only a partial wave was recorded thus no discharge was calculated <br>

<strong><u> ECb</u></strong><br>
R-> Base EC is rising over the span of the dump event <br>
F-> Base EC is falling  the span of the dump event <br>
C-> Base EC is constant over the span of the dump event <br>

<strong><u>Notes</u></strong>
Offset -> Indicating that 2 or more of the salt wave peaks are offset from eachother by more than 35 seconds <br>

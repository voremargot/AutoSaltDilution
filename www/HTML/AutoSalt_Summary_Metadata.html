<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline; font-size:20px">Data Sources and Notes </p>
<p style= "font-size:16px">Note that this table has <strong> 2 primary key columns </strong> </p>
<strong><u>EventID:</u></strong> The EventID value is generated by the autosalt system when a dump event occurs. This ID value comes from the raw dump event file and is a primary key column. <br>
<strong><u>SiteID:</u></strong> This corresponds to the primary key in the site description table, specifying which site the dump event took place at AND is a primary key column. <br>
<strong><u> PeriodID:</u></strong> This corresponds to the primary key in the barrel periods table and specifies which barrel period the dump event took place during. <br>
<strong><u> Date: </u></strong> The date the dump event occurred (YYYY-MM-DD). The date comes from the summary file of dump events in the Hakai repository. <br>
<strong><u> Temp:</u></strong> The stream temperature at the start of the dump event. This information comes from the summary file of dump events in the Hakai repository. <br>
<strong><u> Start Time:</u></strong> The time when the dump event began (local time PST/PDT). The time comes from the summary file of dump events in the Hakai repository.<br>
<strong><u> Stage DR:</u></strong> The stream stage at the time of solution release. The data comes from the summary file of the dump events in the Hakai repository<br>
<strong><u> Stage Min:</u></strong> The minimum stage of the stream over the course of the dump event. <br>
<strong><u> Stage Max:</u></strong> The maximum stage of the stream over the course of the dump event. <br>
<strong><u> Stage Std:</u></strong> The standard deviation of the stage values.<br>
<strong><u> Stage Dir:</u></strong> This specifies how the stage is changing over the span of the dump event.<br>
<strong><u> Salt Volume:</u></strong> The amount of salt solution that is dumped into the stream during the event. This data comes from the summary file of dump events in the Hakai repository.<br>
<strong><u> Discharge Avg:</u></strong> The average of error-free, individual discharge calculations (see all discharge calcs table). <br>
<strong><u> Uncert:</u></strong> The uncertainty of the discharge average.<br>
<strong><u> Flags:</u></strong> Highlights common errors seen within the dump event data.<br>
<strong><u> ECb:</u></strong> Highlights changes in the background EC (ECb) over the duration of the salt curve.<br>
<strong><u> Mixing:</u></strong> Specifies how well mixed the soultion is in the stream once it goes past the EC sensors. <br>
<strong><u> Notes:</u></strong> Specific comments about the overall discharge average or dump event.<br>
<br> 
If you need to know how discharge, uncertainty, and mixing are determined, please see the Methods Description document in the google drive supporting documents folder.<br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Flags</p>
<strong><u> Flags </u></strong><br>
ND -> No raw data was found for the dump event <br>
NW -> Raw data was avaliable but no salt wave occurred<br>
PW -> Only a partial wave was recorded thus no discharge was calculated <br>
AD -> Raw data was taken from the autodump backup file as there is minimal to no data in the regular sensor file. <br>
OS -> Indicating that 2 or more of the salt wave peaks are offset from each other by more than 35 seconds. <br>
<br>
<strong><u> ECb</u></strong><br>
R-> Base EC is rising over the span of the dump event <br>
F-> Base EC is falling  the span of the dump event <br>
C-> Base EC is constant over the span of the dump event <br>
M-> Base EC is mixed meaning the salt waves from each sensor calculated different base EC patterns <br>

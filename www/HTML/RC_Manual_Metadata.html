<strong><u>RCManualID:</u></strong> This is an autogenerated value that is created when a new record is added. <br>
<strong><u>Site ID:</u></strong> This corresponds to the primary key in the site description table and represents which site the discharge collection happened at. <br>
<strong><u> MDisID:</u></strong> This corresponds to the primary key in the manual discharge table and defines which manual discharge collection event we are referencing. <br>
<strong><u> RCID: </u></strong> This corresponds to the primary key in the RC Summary table and defines which version of the rating curve the value is included in. <br>
<strong><u> EventNo:</u></strong> This identifies which precipitation event the discharge value is part of. This value is selected by the user when the rating curve is created and is only avaliable for RC version 4 and above. 
<ul type='disc'><li>The majority of manual discharge events did not occur during a precipitation event, represented by a zero. </li></ul>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:16px"> This table contains raw data uploaded from the device magic form which are then organized into their respective tables. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;text-decoration:underline; font-size:16px"> General Info </p>
<strong><u>DMID:</u></strong> This is an autogenerated value that is created when a new record is added. <br>
<strong><u>Submitted:</u></strong> The date and time the form was submitted from device magic (local time PST/PDT, YYYY-MM-DD). <br>
<strong><u>Date Visit:</u></strong> The date the site visit occurred  (YYYY-MM-DD).<br>
<strong><u>Time Visit:</u></strong> The time the site visit occurred (local time PST/PDT).<br>
<strong><u>SiteID:</u></strong> The site that was visited.<br>
<strong><u>Technician and Technicians Other:</u></strong> List of technicians who were in the field.<br>
<strong><u>Upstream Photo:</u></strong> Link to an upstream photo from the site.<br>
<strong><u>Downstream Photo:</u></strong> Link to a downstream photo from the site.<br>
<strong><u>Barrel Fill:</u></strong> Indicates if a reservoir refill was performed during the visit.<br>
<strong><u>CF Event:</u></strong> Indicates if CF measurements were taken during the visit.<br>
<strong><u>EC Sensor Change:</u></strong> Indicates if there were any EC sensor changes made to the network during the visit.<br><br>

<p style="text-align: center;text-decoration:underline; font-size:16px"> If barrel fill occurred </p>
<strong><u>Volume Solution:</u></strong> This indicates how much solution was in the reservoir before it was refilled.<br>
<strong><u>Salt Added :</u></strong> This indicates how much salt was added to the new solution mixture.<br>
<strong><u>Salt Added :</u></strong> This indicates how much water was added to the new solution mixture.<br>
<strong><u>Volume Depart :</u></strong> This indicates how much salt solution was in the reservoir upon departure.<br>
<strong><u>Salt Remaining Site :</u></strong> This indicates how much salt remains on the site after the mixture was made.<br>
<strong><u>Barrel Fill Notes:</u></strong> This contains any important notes about the refill.<br><br>

<p style="text-align: center;text-decoration:underline; font-size:16px">If CF measurements were taken </p>
<strong><u>Time Barrel Period:</u></strong> This indicates when the measurements occurred in relation to the a barrel fill event.<br>
<strong><u>Trials CF:</u></strong> This indicates how many trials were done for each measurement.<br><br>

<p style="text-align: center;text-decoration:underline; font-size:16px">If changes were made to the sensor network </p>
<strong><u>Action:</u></strong> This tells us what action was performed.<br>
(<strong>Add</strong> a sensor to the network, <strong>Remove</strong> a sensor from the network without replacement, <strong>Replace</strong> a sensor in the network with a new sensor.)<br>
<strong><u>Reason:</u></strong> This indicates a reason for why the change occurred. <br><br>

<p style="text-align: center;text-decoration:underline; font-size:16px"> If a sensor was replaced </p>
<strong><u>Sen R Removed Type (Other):</u></strong> This indicates the removed sensor's type. <br>
<strong><u>Sen R Removed SN:</u></strong> This indicates the removed sensor's serial number. <br>
<strong><u>Sen R New Type (Other):</u></strong> This indicates what the new sensor's type is. <br>
<strong><u>Sen R New SN:</u></strong> This indicates the new sensor's serial number. <br>
<strong><u>Sen R New RiverLoc (Other):</u></strong> This indicates the new sensor's location in the river. <br>
<strong><u>Sen R New ProbeNum:</u></strong> This indicates the new sensor's probe numbe. <br><br>

<p style="text-align: center;text-decoration:underline; font-size:16px"> If a sensor was removed </p>
<strong><u>Sen Remove Type (Other):</u></strong> This indicates the sensor's type. <br>
<strong><u>Sen Remove SN:</u></strong> This indicates the sensor's serial number. <br>
<strong><u>Sen Remove ProbeNum:</u></strong> This indicates the sensor's probe number. <br><br>

<p style="text-align: center;text-decoration:underline; font-size:16px">If a sensor was added </p>
<strong><u>Sen Add Type:</u></strong> This indicates the sensor's type. <br>
<strong><u>Sen Add RiverLoc (Other):</u></strong> This indicates where in the river the sensor was placed. <br>
<strong><u>Sen Add ProbeNum:</u></strong> This indicates the sensor's probe number. <br><br>

<p style="text-align: center;text-decoration:underline; font-size:16px"> General Notes </p>
<strong><u>Notes Weather:</u></strong> The weather during the field visit. <br>
<strong><u>Notes Repairs:</u></strong>Repairs and adjustments that were made during the site visit. <br>
<strong><u>Notes ToDo:</u></strong> Things that need to be done at the site during future visits. <br>
<strong><u>Notes Other:</u></strong> Notes about the visit that do not fit into the other categories. <br><br>

<p style="text-align: center;text-decoration:underline; font-size:16px"> What has been checked by the code </p>
<strong><u>Visit Added:</u></strong> Indicates if the visit information has been added to the Field Visit table. <br>
<strong><u>Barrel Added:</u></strong> Indicates if the barrel fill information has been added to the Barrel Fill table. <br>
<strong><u>Sensor Added:</u></strong> Indicates if the sensor network change information has been added to the Sensor table. <br>
<strong><u>CF Added:</u></strong> Indicates if the CF event information from the device magic form corresponds to what has been entered into the Calibration Event and Results tables. <br><br>

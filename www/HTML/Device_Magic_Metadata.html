<p style="text-align: center; font-size:16px"> All data in this table is the raw data uploaded from the device magic form prior to it being organized into its repective tables. </p>

<strong><u>DMID:</u></strong> This is an autogenerated value that is created when a new record is added. <br>
<strong><u>Submitted:</u></strong> The date and time the form was submitted from the device (local time PST/PDT, YYYY-MM-DD). <br>
<strong><u>Date Visit:</u></strong> The date the site was visited (YYYY-MM-DD).<br>
<strong><u>Time Visit:</u></strong> The time the site was visited (local time PST/PDT).<br>
<strong><u>SiteID:</u></strong>The site that was visited.<br>
<strong><u>Technician and Technicians Other:</u></strong> List of technicians who visted the field.<br>
<strong><u>Upstream Photo:</u></strong> Link to an upstream photo from the site.<br>
<strong><u>Downstream Photo:</u></strong> Link to a downstream photo from the site.<br>
<strong><u>Barrel Fill:</u></strong> Indicates of a reservoir refill was performed during the visit.<br>
<strong><u>CF Event:</u></strong> Indicates if CF mesurements were taken during the visit.<br>
<strong><u>EC Sensor Change:</u></strong> Indicates if there were any EC sensor changes made to the network during the visit.<br><br>

<strong><u>Volume Solution:</u></strong>If a barrel fill occurred, this indicates how much solution was in the reservoir before it was refilled.<br>
<strong><u>Salt Added :</u></strong> If a barrel fill occurred, this indicates how much salt was added to the new solution mixture.<br>
<strong><u>Salt Added :</u></strong> If a barrel fill occurred, this indicates how much water was added to the new solution mixture.<br>
<strong><u>Volume Depart :</u></strong> If a barrel fill occurred, this indicates how much solution mixture was in the reservior upon departure from the site.<br>
<strong><u>Salt Remaining Site :</u></strong> If a barrel fill occurred, this indicates how much salt remains on the site before departure.<br>
<strong><u>Barrel Fill Notes:</u></strong> If a barrel fill occurred, this contains any important note about the refill.<br><br>

<strong><u>Time Barrel Period:</u></strong> If a CF measurement happened, this indicates when the measurements occurred in relation to the a barrel fill event.<br>
<strong><u>Trials CF:</u></strong> If a CF measurement happened, this indicates how many trials were done for each measurement.<br><br>

<strong><u>Action:</u></strong> If the sensor network was changed, this tells us what action was performed.<br>
(<strong> Add</strong> a sensor to the network without replacement, <strong>Remove</strong> a sensor from the network without replacement, <strong>Replace</strong> a sensor in the network with a new sensor.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Reason:</u></strong> If the sensor network was changed, this indicates a reason for why the change occurred. <br><br>

<strong><u>Sen R Removed Type (Other):</u></strong> If a sensor was replaced, this indicates what the removed sensor's type is. <br>
<strong><u>Sen R Removed SN:</u></strong> If a sensor was replaced, this indicates what the removed sensor's serial number is. <br>
<strong><u>Sen R New Type (Other):</u></strong> If a sensor was replaced, this indicates what the new sensor's type is. <br>
<strong><u>Sen R New SN:</u></strong> If a sensor was replaced, this indicates the new sensor's serial number. <br>
<strong><u>Sen R New RiverLoc (Other):</u></strong> If a sensor was replaced, this indicates the new sensor's location in the river. <br>
<strong><u>Sen R New ProbeNum:</u></strong> If a sensor was replaced, this indicates the new sensor's probe number <br><br>

<strong><u>Sen Remove Type (Other):</u></strong> If a sensor was removed, this indicates the sensor's type. <br>
<strong><u>Sen Remove SN:</u></strong> If a sensor was removed, this indicates the sensor's serial number. <br>
<strong><u>Sen Remove ProbeNum:</u></strong> If a sensor was removed, this indicates the sensor's probe number. <br><br>

<strong><u>Sen Add Type:</u></strong> If a sensor was added, this indicates the sensor's type. <br>
<strong><u>Sen Add RiverLoc (Other):</u></strong> If a sensor was added, this indicates where in the river the sensor was placed. <br>
<strong><u>Sen Add ProbeNum:</u></strong> If a sensor was added, this indicates the sensor's probe number. <br><br>

<strong><u>Notes Weather:</u></strong> General notes about the weather during the field visit. <br>
<strong><u>Notes Repairs:</u></strong> General notes about repairs and adjustments that were made during the site visit. <br>
<strong><u>Notes ToDo:</u></strong> General notes about things that need to be done at the site at future visits. <br>
<strong><u>Notes Other:</u></strong> General notes about the visit that do not fit into the other note catagories. <br><br>

<strong><u>Visit Added:</u></strong> Indicates if the visit information has been added to the Field Visit table. <br>
<strong><u>Barrel Added:</u></strong> Indicates if the barrel fill information has been added to the Barrel Fill table. <br>
<strong><u>Sensor Added:</u></strong> Indicates if the sensor network change information has been added to the Sensor table. <br>
<strong><u>CF Added:</u></strong>Indicates if the CF values have been correctly entered into the Calibration Event and Results tables. <br>

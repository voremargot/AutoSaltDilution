<strong><u> Starting Date:</u></strong> The date when the barrel was refilled with new solution (YYYY-MM-DD). <br>
<strong><u> Ending Date: </u></strong> The date when the next refill occurs (YYYY-MM-DD). <br>
<strong><u> Solution at Start: </u></strong> This is the amount of salt solution in the reservoir when the barrel period began.<br>
<strong><u> Solution at End: </u></strong> This is the amount of salt solution in the the reservoir before the refill occurs.<br>
<strong><u> Salt Added: </u></strong> The amount of salt that was added when the solution was being refilled. <br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Data Constraints </p>
1. The <strong>Starting date</strong> must occur before the <strong>ending date</strong>.<br>
2. The <strong>ending date </strong> of barrel period x will usually be the same as the starting date for period x+1. <br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Table Update Notes</p>
When adding a <strong> new barrel fill event </strong> to this table, be sure to edit the ending date of the previous barrel fill from null to a valid date. This will ensure that there is only one active barrel fill period per site.

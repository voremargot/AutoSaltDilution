<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline; font-size:20px">Data Sources and Notes </p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:16px"> All data in this table has been copied from the device magic form that is filled out during site visits. </p>

<strong><u>PeriodID:</u></strong> This value is autogenerated when a new record is added. <br>
<strong><u>SiteID:</u></strong> This corresponds to the primary key in the site description table and tells us what site the barrel fill occurred at.<br>
<strong><u> Starting Date:</u></strong> The date when the barrel was refilled with new solution (YYYY-MM-DD). <br>
<strong><u> Ending Date: </u></strong> The date when the next refill occurs (YYYY-MM-DD).<br>
<strong><u> Solution at Start: </u></strong> The amount of salt solution in the reservoir when the barrel period began.<br>
<strong><u> Solution at End: </u></strong> The amount of salt solution in the reservoir at the end of the barrel period.<br>
<strong><u> Salt Added: </u></strong> The amount of salt that was added when the solution was being refilled. <br>
<strong><u> Salt Remaining on Site: </u></strong> The amount of salt that is on site for future refills. <br>
<strong><u> Notes: </u></strong> Notes taken in the field during reservoir refill.<br>
<br>


<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Units of Data</p>
<strong>Solution at Start</strong> --> L (rounded to the nearest 25L)<br>
<strong>Solution at End</strong> --> L (rounded to the nearest 25L)<br>
<strong>Salt Added</strong> --> kg<br>
<strong>Salt Remaining on Site</strong> --> kg<br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Data Constraints </p>
1. The <strong>Starting date</strong> must occur before the <strong>ending date</strong>.<br>
2. The <strong>ending date </strong> of barrel period x will usually be the same as the starting date for period x+1. <br>
3. When adding a <strong> new barrel fill event </strong> to this table, be sure to edit the ending date of the previous barrel fill from null to a valid date. This will ensure that there is only one active barrel fill period per site. <br>

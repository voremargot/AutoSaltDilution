<p style= "text-align: center">THE USER MUST UPDATE ALL COLUMNS IN THIS TABLE BY HAND</p>

<strong><u>SensorID:</u></strong> This is an autogenerated value that is created when a new row is added. <br>
<strong><u>SiteID:</u></strong>The SiteID cooresponds to the SiteID column in the site_description table. <br>
<strong><u> Probe Number:</u></strong> The probe number the sensor cooresponds with in the raw data file. <br>
<strong><u> Sensor Type: </u></strong> The type of sensor used. <br>
<strong><u> Serial Number:</u></strong> The sensor's serial number.<br>
<strong><u> River Loc:</u></strong> The location of the sensor in the river. <br>
<strong><u> Install Date:</u></strong> The date when the sensor was installed at the site.<br>
<strong><u> Deactivation Date:</u></strong> The date when the sensor was removed from the site. <br>
<br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Units of Data</p>
<strong><u> Sensor Type</u></strong> --> Accepted values: THRECS, WQ, Fathom <br>
<strong><u> River Loc</u></strong> --> Accepted values: RR, RL, RR-L, RR-H, RL-L, RL-H, RC, Lab<br>
<p><strong>RR</strong>-> river right, <strong>RL</strong>-> river left, <strong>RC</strong>-> river center, <strong>-L</strong>-> low, <strong>-H</strong>-> high </p>
<br>


<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Data Constraints </p>
1. The <strong>install date </strong> must occur before the <stong>deactivation date</strong>.<br>
2. The <strong>sensor type</strong> and <stong>river loc</strong> can only be recorded as one of the accepted values. If different values need to be added, the data type will need to be changed within the database scheme.<br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">General Table Notes </p>
The sensor record was not well documented so the activation and deactivation dates prior to 2020 are the best guess. You may find when working with sensor data prior to 2020 some inconsistencies between the sensors that were used for CF measurements and sensors used for discharge calculations. Please keep this in mind when working with the historical data sets. <br>

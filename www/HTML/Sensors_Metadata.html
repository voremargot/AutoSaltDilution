<p style= "text-align: center">THE USER MUST UPDATE ALL COLUMNS IN THIS TABLE BY HAND</p>

<strong><u>SensorID:</u></strong> This is an autogenerated value that is created when a new row is added. <br>
<strong><u>SiteID:</u></strong>This corresponds to the primary key in the site_description table and tells us which the site the sensor is at. <br>
<strong><u> Probe Number:</u></strong> The probe number the sensor corresponds with in the raw data file. <br>
<strong><u> Sensor Type: </u></strong> The type of sensor used. <br>
<strong><u> Serial Number:</u></strong> The sensor's serial number.<br>
<strong><u> River Loc:</u></strong> The location of the sensor in the river. <br>
<strong><u> Install Date:</u></strong> The date when the sensor was installed at the site.<br>
<strong><u> Deactivation Date:</u></strong> The date when the sensor was removed from the site. <br>
<br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Units of Data</p>
<strong><u> Sensor Type</u></strong> --> Accepted values: THRECS, WQ, Fathom <br>
<strong><u> River Loc</u></strong> --> Accepted values: RR, RL, RR-L, RR-H, RL-L, RL-H, RC, Lab<br>
<p><strong>RR</strong>-> river right, <strong>RL</strong>-> river left, <strong>RC</strong>-> river center, <strong>-L</strong>-> low, <strong>-H</strong>-> high </p>
<br>


<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Data Constraints </p>
1. The <strong>install date </strong> must occur before the <strong>deactivation date</strong>.<br>
2. The <strong>sensor type</strong> and <strong>river loc</strong> can only be recorded as one of the accepted values. If different values need to be added, the data type will need to be changed within the database scheme.<br>
3. When a sensor is replaced be sure to set the <strong> deactivation date </strong> from null to a valid date. Each probe number can only have one sensor with a null deactivation date to ensure consistency within the data. <br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">General Table Notes </p>
The sensor record was not well documented prior to 2020 so the activation and deactivation dates are a best guess. When working with sensor data prior to 2020 you may find some inconsistencies between the sensors that were used for CF measurements and sensors used for discharge calculations. <br>

<strong><u>WaveID:</u></strong> This is an autogenerated value that is created when a new record is added. <br>
<strong><u>Site ID:</u></strong> This comes from the primary key of the Autosalt Summary table and tells us which site the salt wave relates to.<br>
<strong><u> EventID:</u></strong> This comes from the primary key of the Autosalt Summary table and tells us which event the salt wave relates to.<br>
<strong><u> SensorID: </u></strong> This comes from the primary key of the sensors table and tells us which sensor the salt wave was seen in.<br>
<strong><u> Start ECWave:</u></strong>The time when the EC wave started. This is determined by the code. <br>
<strong><u> End ECWave:</u></strong> The time when the EC wave ended. This is determined by the code. <br>
<strong><u> Time MaxEC:</u></strong> This is the time when the maximum EC value is reached.<br>
<strong><u> StartingEC:</u></strong> This is the average EC value prior to the salt wave occurring.<br>
<strong><u> EndingEC:</u></strong> This is the average EC after the salt wave has passed. <br>
<strong><u> PeakEC:</u></strong> The maximum EC values that occurred during the salt wave. <br>
<strong><u>Flags:</u></strong> Highlights common errors within the salt wave. <br>
<strong><u> Comment:</u></strong> Specific notes regarding the salt wave.  <br>
<br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Units of Data</p>
<strong><u> StartingEC</u></strong> --> uS/cm <br>
<strong><u> EndingEC</u></strong> --> uS/cm<br>
<strong><u> PeakEC</u></strong> --> uS/cm<br>
<br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Flags</p>
L -> The EC value is low (Average EC <5) <br>
M -> Multiple peaks occur in the salt wave <br>
N -> Minimal to no salt wave occurs (sensor may be out of the water)<br>
S-> Salt wave has significant spikes<br>
Sd -> Salt wave has high standard deviations making the data noisy<br>
Pw-> There is a partial wave (missing parts of either the falling or rising limb)<br>
T-> Timing of salt waves between two or more sensors is off (time of peak EC is different by more than 45sec). <br>

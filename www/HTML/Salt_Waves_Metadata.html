<strong><u>WaveID (PK):</u></strong> This is an autogenerated value. <br>
<strong><u>Site ID (FK):</u></strong> This comes from the primary key of the Autosalt Summary table and tells us which site and event the salt wave relates to.<br>
<strong><u> EventID (FK):</u></strong> This comes from the primary key of the Autosalt Summary table and tells us which event the salt wave relates to.<br>
<strong><u> SensorID (FK): </u></strong> This comes from the primark key of the sensors table and tells us which sensor the salt wave occurred in<br>
<strong><u> Start ECWave:</u></strong>The time when the EC wave started. this is determined in the code<br>
<strong><u> End ECWave:</u></strong> The time when the EC wave ended. This is determined in the code<br>
<strong><u> Time MaxEC:</u></strong> This is the time when the maximum EC value is reached.<br>
<strong><u> StartingEC:</u></strong> This is the average EC value prior to the salt wave occurring.<br>
<strong><u> EndingEC:</u></strong> This is the average EC after the salt wave has passed. <br>
<strong><u> PeakEC:</u></strong> The maximum EC values that occur during the salt wave. <br>
<strong><u>Flags:</u></strong> Highlights common errors and occurrances within the salt wave <br>
<strong><u> Comment:</u></strong> Specific notes regarding the salt wave<br>
<br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Units of Data</p>
<strong><u> StartingEC</u></strong> --> uS/cm <br>
<strong><u> EndingEC</u></strong> --> uS/cm<br>
<strong><u> PeakEC</u></strong> --> uS/cm<br>
<br>

<p style= "text-align: center; text-decoration:underline;font-size:20px">Flags</p>
L -> The EC value is low (<10)
M -> Multiple peaks occur in the salt wave <br>
N -> Minimal to no salt wave occurs (sensor may be out of the water)<br>
S-> Salt wave has significant spikes<br>
SD -> Salt wave has high standard deviations making the data nosiy<br>
P-> There is a partial wave (missing either falling or rising limb)<br>
T-> Timing of salt waves at different sensors are off<br>
Df -> Starting EC is more than 5units lower than other sensors
